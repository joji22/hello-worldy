I'm a photographic based designer who got into web design 21yrs ago... 
Got an update in 2005 when I went back to school for web design...
Got laid off and hoped to finish up with web design yet when the option of graphic design came up I jumped for it but didn't realize I had to jump though a number of hoops to get it...
Went for publishing arts hoping that it would give me what I sought but it didn't so I'm back on the web tech path.
